# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Odin Project - JavaScript Challenge

This project is part of the **JavaScript Foundations** course from The Odin Project. It focuses on reinforcing core web development skills â€” **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the project is to build a fully functional **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game that runs directly in the browser.

### Overview

In this project, I implemented a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where the user competes against the computer. The goal was to:

- **Practice JavaScript fundamentals** like variables, functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
- **Improve problem-solving skills** by breaking down a problem into smaller steps and writing pseudocode before diving into the code.
- **Enhance HTML & CSS skills** by creating a simple but visually appealing UI.

### Features

- **User vs. Computer**: The game lets the user choose between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer makes a random choice.
- **Score Tracking**: The user's and computer's scores are tracked throughout the game, and the display updates in real time.
- **Restart Button**: A restart button allows the user to reset the scores and start a new game.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game and making the UI visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the game logic, handle user interactions, and update the DOM with real-time scores.

### How It Works

1. The user selects one of the three choices: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
3. The game logic compares both choices and determines the winner (user wins, computer wins, or it's a tie).
4. The scores for both the user and the computer are displayed and updated after each round.
5. The user can restart the game at any time by clicking the **Restart** button, which resets the scores to zero.

### Next Steps / Improvements

- **Animations**: Add animations when showing the user and computer's choices to make the game more interactive.
- **Sound Effects**: Include sounds for different events like winning, losing, or tying.

### Reflection

This project was a great exercise in combining **problem-solving** with **practical coding skills**. It helped solidify the understanding of **JavaScript functions**, **event handling**, and **DOM manipulation**. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of breaking a problem down into smaller steps and planning out the structure before diving into code.
